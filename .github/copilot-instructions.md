## Project Overview
This is an Interactive Data Visualization Generator built with modern JavaScript and Vite. The project showcases advanced JavaScript features including:

- ES6+ modules and modern syntax
- Async/await patterns for data processing
- Canvas manipulation for custom visualizations
- Web APIs for file handling and exports
- Real-time data simulation
- Responsive design patterns

## Code Style Guidelines
- Use ES6+ features consistently
- Implement proper error handling with try/catch
- Follow modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Implement responsive design principles

## Architecture
- `/src/components/` - Reusable UI components
- `/src/charts/` - Chart type implementations
- `/src/utils/` - Utility functions and helpers
- `/src/data/` - Data processing and generation
- `/src/themes/` - Theme configurations
- `/src/exports/` - Export functionality

## Key Features to Maintain
- Multiple chart types (bar, line, pie, scatter, heatmap)
- Real-time data updates
- Customizable themes
- Export functionality (PNG, SVG, JSON)
- Responsive design
- Modern build pipeline with Vite
